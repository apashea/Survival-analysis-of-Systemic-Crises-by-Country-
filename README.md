# Survival-analysis-of-Systemic-Crises-by-Country-
This project presents Kaplan-Meier survival curves and their plots of systemic crises (for now, in Belgium, France, United Kingdom, and Germany) using data collected by Harvard Business School (see citation in code for the plots).

The Kaplan-Meier survival curve is generally the simplest computational method for survival analyses. In the future I would like to try other methods that allow for inclusion of multivariates, such as the Cox model. This data also includes banking crises, which might in future be compared to the systemic crises' time-series.

I've been interested in financial and banking crises for quite some time and thought survival analysis, rather unorthodox for looking at this kind of data, would nonetheless be interesting given this data's structure fits the time-to-event structure with time being the year and event being equal to 1 for a crisis' occurence and equal to 0 for no crisis during that year.
